These enums define some of the errors that may be thrown when using the Stitch iOS SDK. 

However, this is not an exhaustive list. Many of the potential errors that are thrown are actually defined in the `StitchCore` module, whose errors are documented here (link TODO). Specifically, most errors related to responses from the MongoDB Stitch server are defined in the `StitchCore.StitchError` enum.
